# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> This is a basic Social Media App (think Facebook) where users can befriend other users where the main objective was to build advanced model associations.

# About

> This is a social media app where you can create posts, add other users as friends, and make comments or like another post. The main purpose of this project was to build advanced associations, scopes for faster queries, and model methods.

What you can do on the app:
- Sign up and Log in
- Add other users as friends
- Accept or rejects friend requests
- See the status of your relationship with other users
- Create posts and see posts from your friends
- Users can comment and like on their friends' posts

In this project we:
- Used PostgreSQL as the database
- Created advanced associations between users
- Used scopes to make more efficient database queries
- Created models, views, and controllers for users
- Used devise gem for user authentication and authorization
- We implemented integration tests with Capybara
- Used Rspec to test model validations and associations
